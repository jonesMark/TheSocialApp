TheSocialApp
============
Professor U okays this readme file.

Our first project

The first visible screen is the Facebook login screen. When clicked, you will move on to the Home page in the main program. If you click the main image on this page, it will open to the top half of the event page as a popup. Click this again to close. If you click the second tab at the top of the screen, you will be brought to the full calendar page. Clicking on this image will bring up a popup of the different categories that you would be able to sort events by. Clicking this image will close it. Click the third tab at the top of the screen to go to the favorites calendar. Click this image to pop up the second half of the event page. (The social chat - ideally the event would contain both images and be scrollable on all three tabs). Click this image to close.

No piece of this code was created entirely by one programmer. We added on to each other's files frequently. 

***We based some of our code off of tutorials on the android developers website***
